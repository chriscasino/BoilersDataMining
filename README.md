# 3920 Project 


## Cleaning
We used two datasets, one from the HPD, and one from the DOB

### Using Python Pandas
### Using thefuzz package

## Models
j,nm,nmnm
### Association Rule
An association rule uses dependency rules to determine how likely an outcome is. This model is ideal for dataset containing multiple categrocial attributes, since it groups combinations fo such attributes to create what are known as itemsets. From these itemsets, a list of frequent itemsets are generated, which are combinations of attributes that appear above a certain threshold. This threshold is known as the support. 
It is comprised of two parts: the antecedent and the outcome.  In this project, we were interested in how likely an outcome is:
